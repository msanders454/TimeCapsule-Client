# The Time Capsule

“Memories will last forever”

## How it works 

This is a fun little app that users can create in order to remember memories/ talk to themselves in the future. Give yourself some life advice, or just a funny Meme to laugh at.

Users will create an account and and login in. Once they are logged in, they can start making capsules. Once a user has a capsule, it will either be locked or be available to view. The capsules will blink when they are able to view.
